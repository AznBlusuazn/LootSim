ABOUT THIS GAME

LOOTSIM is an early development game that
brings the joys of opening crates and getting
loot to the PC.  Players will be able to get
free loot multiple times a day, buy loot from
the marketplace, sell loot to others in the
marketplace, and trade loot for other loot in
the marketplace.

This game is still in early concept stage.
